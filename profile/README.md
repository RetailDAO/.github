# RetailDAO

Welcome to Retail DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) dedicated to empowering retail investors to achieve financial freedom through community-driven governance and collective wisdom. Operating on the Base Network, our $RETAIL governance token enables transparent, community-led decision-making.

## Mission
Our mission is to provide retail investors with the tools, knowledge, and governance framework to make informed investment decisions, leveraging collective wisdom to navigate the path to financial independence.

## Governance
Retail DAO uses a hybrid governance model:
- **Original Mint Authorized DAO**: Used to mint the $RETAIL token (1 billion total supply, minting to be revoked for transparency).
- **Current Governance DAO**: Manages on-chain governance using $RETAIL tokens.
- **Multisigs**

- **Off-Chain Governance**:
  - [Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:retaildaobase.eth) for minor proposals.
  - Discord polls for community sentiment.

## Repositories
Our GitHub Organization is structured to ensure transparency and accessibility:

- **[governance](https://github.com/RetailDAO/Governance)**: Governance rules, proposals, and voting records.
- **[treasury](https://github.com/RetailDAO/Treasury)**: Financial records, budgets, and funding proposals.
